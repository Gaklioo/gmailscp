I would never let them in my squad ever.",

The fact that they still are within the Foundation is amazing to me. It shows the true incompetence of the Foundation to let someone like that work here. They are nothing but a waste of space and need to be fired ASAP because really they are the most ridiculous person I've ever seen.",
    "%s is the laziest Foundation person in the world. They are nothing but a useless sack of potatoes and do nothing for the Foundation but waste resources. They are foolish and careless, and without them we would be so much further ahead in our research and containment abilities. I've seen turtles outrun them because they are just that slow. There is nothing more in this world that I dislike than people who move slow, and there is nothing I wouldn't do for them to go away.",
    "There is nothing more that %s hates in this world than the color pink and it's so silly. Knowing that they hate this color so much is incredible because it's just a color. Every time I hear them talk they're always complaining about how everything is pink. It is such a pointless waste of time to talk to them because there is nothing they talk about other than how everything is pink. I would rather watch paint dry than talk to them ever again.",
    "There are just some people that have huge egos that will never be quelled like %s's. Every time I hear them talk it's like they have the biggest head in the universe and just can't get over themselves. There is nothing more in this world that I hate than people who just can't stop talking about themselves. It's like they are just so incompetent that everything needs to be about them. They just sit here and ruin the Foundation because they are unable to speak normally, and no one likes it at all.",

Every single time this person gets an eye exam they fail it and there is nothing more in this world that I hate than them trying to claim they passed. A person who never gets a proper eye exam and then complains how perfect their eyesight is when they can't see anything. A bunch of ridiculous nonsense coming from the most clueless person in the entire Foundation.",

They never will though because they're nothing but a goofy little gremlin that sits in their hidey hole all day like some complete fool or something. There is nothing more in this Foundation that I dislike than them. They are the most useless person I have ever seen and do nothing but waste space and air within the Foundation because they are the biggest bald-headed goof in the world.",

They just sit there and deny every test because they think that they are the rulers of the Foundation and nothing is above them. They think they are absolute but in reality they are the most ineffective people in the world. Without them research would be so far ahead, and life would be so much better without their constant interference within the Foundation and its normal operations. A bunch of totally useless people is what they are.",

It's so silly how they think they are above everything, and everything they do is the absolute biggest waste of time in the world. They do nothing but act superior to the rest of the Foundation and waste our time. Without them the Foundation would be so far ahead in proper procedures because they are so ineffective it's unbelievable. They just sit there and do nothing for the Foundation.",

They are a bunch of ineffective people who do nothing within the Foundation at all. They are extremely incompetent and so bad at their job that they should all be replaced and the entire command should be restructured from top to bottom. The day that GenSec is reformed is the day I am truly happy within this life.",

They are supposed to sit there and do their job but in reality they do nothing. %s has seen them literally sitting there complaining for 10 hours straight instead of actually researching and doing their job. This ineffective command team does nothing for the Foundation and I swear there is no reason at all that they should exist. The Foundation says they are important but in reality they do nothing for us at all because they are just a pain for everybody.",
    "I think really that %s is a reality bender. There are times that I'll watch someone shoot at them, and the bullets just never hit. It is the weirdest thing in the world and I swear that they are able to dodge bullets without any issue like a reality bender would. It is the oddest thing in the world and they should really be removed because I swear that they are a type green. It is a risky thing to have a type green working as Foundation staff because that is just danger waiting to happen at any point.",
    "I swear Alpha-1 just gets away with whatever they want. They are the most clueless group in the Foundation, and %s agrees. They are the most ineffective team ever, and the Foundation would operate way better without their presence. If they would just disappear, then all of the world would be better off. No one likes them anyway. A bunch of useless people who truly don't mean anything for the greater cause.",

They are a bunch of ineffective people who do nothing at all for us. They really just make the site worse. They claim to love ethics but they break the rules all the time. It really means nothing when those enforcing the rules break themâ€”it just makes it worse for the rest of us."
